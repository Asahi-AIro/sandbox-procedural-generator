AI-driven sandbox world generator prototype
# Sandbox Procedural Generator

## Overview
This is a prototype for an AI-powered sandbox world where the environment dynamically evolves based on player actions. Inspired by Minecraft and Roblox, the goal is to create a procedural world generation system that integrates intelligence and interactivity.

## Vision
I want to explore how AI can generate not just random terrain, but meaningful worlds that reflect player behavior, history, and intent. This is a long-term sandbox project to experiment with ideas such as:

- Player-driven environmental changes
- AI-learned biome shaping
- Procedural narrative/worldbuilding

## Planned Features
- 2D/3D terrain generator using Perlin/Simplex noise
- AI-assisted map shaping (e.g. preference-based terrain)
- Dynamic events (volcanoes, forests, dungeons) triggered by AI logic
- Modular plugin system for experimentation

## Technologies (planned)
- Python (prototyping)
- Unity or Godot (visual sandbox)
- Reinforcement Learning (optional)
- OpenAI API or custom LLM for narrative design

## Status
ðŸŸ¡ Planning phase. Currently building base systems for terrain generation and design logic.
